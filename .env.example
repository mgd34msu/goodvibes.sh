# GitHub OAuth Configuration
# --------------------------
# These credentials are used for GitHub integration in GoodVibes.
#
# OPTION 1: Device Flow (Recommended for Desktop Apps)
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Device flow only requires a Client ID - no client secret needed!
# This is the recommended approach for native/desktop applications.
#
# To set up GitHub OAuth App for Device Flow:
# 1. Go to https://github.com/settings/developers
# 2. Click "New OAuth App"
# 3. Fill in the application details:
#    - Application name: GoodVibes (or your preferred name)
#    - Homepage URL: https://github.com/your-username/goodvibes
#    - Authorization callback URL: http://localhost/callback (required but unused for device flow)
# 4. Click "Register application"
# 5. Enable "Device Authorization Flow" in the app settings
# 6. Copy the Client ID below
#
# The default Client ID is for GoodVibes. You can use your own.
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Ov23lifAVInDygX73ltt

# OPTION 2: Authorization Code Flow (Legacy)
# ------------------------------------------
# If you prefer the traditional OAuth flow with redirects, you can also
# provide a client secret. This is less common for desktop apps.
#
# GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
#
# IMPORTANT: Do not commit your .env file to version control!
