# GitHub OAuth Configuration
# --------------------------
# These credentials are used for GitHub integration in Clausitron.
#
# To set up GitHub OAuth:
# 1. Go to https://github.com/settings/developers
# 2. Click "New OAuth App"
# 3. Fill in the application details:
#    - Application name: Clausitron (or your preferred name)
#    - Homepage URL: https://github.com/your-username/clausitron
#    - Authorization callback URL: http://localhost/callback
# 4. Click "Register application"
# 5. Copy the Client ID and generate a Client Secret
# 6. Create a .env file (copy this file) and fill in the values
#
# For desktop apps like Clausitron, embedding the client secret is standard practice.
# The OAuth flow is still secure because:
# - The authorization code is short-lived
# - The user must explicitly authorize the app
# - The redirect happens to localhost
#
# IMPORTANT: Do not commit your .env file to version control!
