# Theme Plan

Take note of all of the colors used in the project as of now - we're about to implement a set of themes, so I want our current settings to be Goodvibes Classic.

In addition to that, I want you to implement Catppuccin (all variants), as well as any of the other popular themes for IDEs etc.

This is going to be a large undertaking.
